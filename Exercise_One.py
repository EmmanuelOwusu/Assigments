**QUESTION 1**


#The objective of this session is to practice with basic tensor manipulations in pytorch, to understand
#the relation between a tensor and its underlying storage, and get a sense of the efficiency of tensorbased computation compared to their equivalent python iterative implementations.

**QUESTION 2**

#Generate two square matrices of dimension 5000 Ã— 5000 filled with random Gaussian coefficients,
#compute their product, measure the time it takes, and estimate how many floating point products
#have been executed per second (should be in the billions or tens of billions).

#Write a function mul row, using python loops (and not even slicing operators), that gets a 2d tensor
